## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Improve Current Method ‚úÖ
- [x] Better messaging about security warnings
- [x] Clear installation instructions
- [x] Professional presentation

### Phase 2: Add Homebrew Distribution üöß
```bash
# Create Homebrew tap
gh repo create your-username/homebrew-tap
cd homebrew-tap
cp ../homebrew/i-cant-code.rb Casks/
git add . && git commit -m "Add i-cant-code cask"
git push

brew tap your-username/tap
brew install --cask i-cant-code
```

### Phase 3: GitHub Releases Integration
- Automate releases with GitHub Actions
- Provide checksums for security
- Enable auto-updates in the app

## Making Security Warnings Less Scary

### 1. Educational Messaging
Instead of "security warning", frame it as:
- "Standard installation process for indie apps"
- "Same method used by popular developer tools"
- "Direct distribution (not App Store)"

### 2. Video Tutorial
Create a 30-second video showing the installation process

### 3. Trust Indicators
- Open source code on GitHub
- Clear privacy policy
- Developer contact information
- User testimonials

## Code Signing Alternatives

### 1. Self-Signed Certificates
- Create your own certificate
- Still shows warnings but with your name
- Free but not as trusted

### 2. Community Verification
- Submit to security scanning services
- Get community reviews
- Build reputation over time

### 3. Gradual Trust Building
- Start with direct distribution
- Build user base and reviews
- Consider paid certificate later if revenue justifies it

## Implementation Steps

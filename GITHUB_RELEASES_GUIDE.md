# GitHub Releases Distribution Guide

This guide shows how to use GitHub Releases as a professional distribution method alongside your website.

## Benefits of GitHub Releases üì¶

### For Users
- **Trusted platform** - developers know and trust GitHub
- **Version history** - see all previous releases
- **Release notes** - know what's new in each version
- **Direct download** - no intermediate pages
- **Community features** - issues, discussions, stars

### For Developers  
- **Free hosting** - unlimited bandwidth for open source
- **Professional presentation** - looks legitimate
- **Automatic workflows** - build and release automatically
- **Version management** - semantic versioning built-in
- **Analytics** - download counts and statistics

## How It Works

### 1. **Automated Releases**
When you create a git tag:
```bash
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

The GitHub Action automatically:
- Builds your app
- Creates a GitHub Release
- Uploads DMG and ZIP files
- Adds release notes

### 2. **User Experience**
Users can:
- Go to `https://github.com/yourusername/transcode/releases`
- See all versions with changelogs
- Download the latest DMG
- Still need to right-click ‚Üí Open (same as website)

### 3. **Integration with Other Methods**

**Website Integration:**
```html
<!-- Add to your download page -->
<a href="https://github.com/yourusername/transcode/releases/latest">
  üì¶ Download from GitHub
</a>
```

**Homebrew Integration:**
```ruby
# Homebrew can point to GitHub releases
url "https://github.com/yourusername/transcode/releases/download/v#{version}/i-cant-code-mac.dmg"
```

## Setup Steps

### 1. **Enable GitHub Actions** ‚úÖ
The workflow file is already created at `.github/workflows/release.yml`

### 2. **Create Your First Release**
```bash
# Make sure your code is committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare v1.0.0 release"

# Create and push a tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 3. **GitHub Actions Will:**
- Build your app automatically
- Create a release with your DMG
- Add professional release notes
- Make it available for download

### 4. **Update Your Website**
Add GitHub as an alternative download option:

```tsx
// In your download page component
<div className="download-options">
  <button onClick={() => downloadFromWebsite()}>
    üì• Download from Website
  </button>
  
  <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/transcode/releases/latest" 
     className="github-download">
    üì¶ Download from GitHub
  </a>
  
  <div className="homebrew-option">
    üç∫ Or install via Homebrew: <code>brew install --cask i-cant-code</code>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Release Process

### Manual Release
```bash
# 1. Update version in package.json
npm version patch  # or minor, major

# 2. Build and test locally
npm run build:mac

# 3. Create and push tag
git push origin main
git push origin --tags

# 4. GitHub Actions handles the rest!
```

### Automated Release (Recommended)
Set up semantic versioning with conventional commits:
- `feat: new feature` ‚Üí minor version bump
- `fix: bug fix` ‚Üí patch version bump  
- `feat!: breaking change` ‚Üí major version bump

## User Download Experience

### From GitHub Releases Page
1. User visits `github.com/yourusername/transcode/releases`
2. Sees professional release page with:
   - Version history
   - Release notes
   - Download links
   - File sizes and checksums
3. Downloads DMG
4. Same installation process (right-click ‚Üí Open)

### Benefits Over Direct Website Download
- **Trust factor** - GitHub is trusted by developers
- **Transparency** - open source, can see the code
- **Community** - users can report issues, contribute
- **Professional appearance** - looks like a real software project
